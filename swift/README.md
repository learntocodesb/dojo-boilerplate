# Swift TDD Instructions
(Based on setup instructions from http://samuelmullen.com/2014/09/unit-testing-in-swift/).

Open the project in XCode by opening the file `Numeral.xcodeproj`, then run âŒ˜U to run the tests. The build and tests should both succeed.

Find the tests at `NumeralTests/NumeralTests.swift` and the production code at `Numeral/Numeral.swift`.
